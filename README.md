I wanted to create a harry potter themed wack a mole game that 
includes decoys that subtract the score
multiple rounds that increase speed and shortens time
# wackAMole

   // ----------------------main goals-------------------------
   commit once per day 
   2 player game
   winstate
   lose state
   try again?
   
   // ----------------------stretch goals-------------------------
    // multilple rounds / increased speed double points
    // pop up menu for game start / gameover/ new round/do you want to continue
    // 2 player high score counter
    // sound on wack /game over
    // keyframe on wack /gameover
